TODOs
----------


Finish off controller checking + models
-Check scoping, joins, permissions finished
-Make default views not include closed tickets, think about switching this
-Follow-up Ticket // Clone to Knowledge base
-Add in parent categories to allow ticket to be transferred to other departments /
-Ticket Category on Sidebar /
-change storelocations to stores
-make ticket_type and priority into tables /
-make tickets have ancestry
-pundit perms on specific fields


Time Taken for breached tickets /
-Either a SQL view X
-Or a Time_Taken Multiple tickets /
-Test view, listing tickets as breached /
-SQL trigger created for new ticket status
-Constraint reqd so new status cannot be added; validation required on this plus error handling
-Ticket_breach_criteria table: per category, per type, per priority breach criteria /
--How does this work with category tree structure? ticket_sla_id inserted after each update

Admin panels
-Ticket_Categories
-Ticket_Statuses
-Ticket_Priorities
-Ticket_SLA_Assignment
-Organisations
-User_Organisation_Assignment
-View User Roles

Populate the database correctly

-set things not null
-Write the SQL imports
-Work out how to generate ancestry in SQL

Model validation
-Once done make sure we can move all to delegates


Dashboard views
